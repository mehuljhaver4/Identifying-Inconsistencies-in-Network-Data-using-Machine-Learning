# Identifying Inconsistencies in Network Data using ML
### Team Members: Aakansh Togani, Mehul Jhaver, Sankalp Pandey

### Brief Description:
* The Identifying Inconsistencies in Network Data using ML project is a machine learning model designed to detect anomalies in network data.
* The project explored and evaluated different methods to identify inconsistencies and suggested recommendations for practical application.
* The model achieved 93% accuracy in identifying potential security breaches using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
* This system can help organizations identify potential security breaches and take proactive measures to prevent them.
